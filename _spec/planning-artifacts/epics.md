# Situation Monitor - Epic Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for Situation Monitor, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, UX Design, and Architecture into implementable stories.

## Fork Development Contract (Cross-Cutting Definition of Done)

Every fork story in every epic MUST satisfy ALL of the following before merge:

1. **Tier Declared** — Story states its hook tier (1/2/3); Tier 3 includes justification for why Tier 1/2 is insufficient (ARCH-9)
2. **Graceful Degradation** — Every fork function wraps in try/catch with `console.warn('[fork] ...')` fallback; fork errors never crash upstream (ARCH-25)
3. **Token-Only Styling** — Uses `--sm-*` or upstream semantic tokens; zero hardcoded hex values (UX-REQ-30)
4. **Fork DOM Convention** — Uses `data-sm-*` attributes for CSS targeting; no new DOM IDs (UX-REQ-32)
5. **Companion Tests** — Unit test in `src/fork/__tests__/` using `node --test`; Tier 2 patches include signature assertions (ARCH-21, UX-REQ-42)
6. **No Upstream Mods** — Zero upstream file modifications unless Tier 3 justified and documented as merge debt (ARCH-12)

## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements

FR1: Users can view a 3D globe with real-time data overlay clusters representing active global events
FR2: Users can click globe clusters to navigate to specific countries or regions and see detailed data
FR3: Users can view data panels for each of the 17 intelligence domains (conflict, seismology, cyber, energy, markets, etc.)
FR4: Users can cross-reference data across multiple domain panels simultaneously (e.g., conflict + markets + prediction markets)
FR5: Users can view AI-generated summaries and threat classifications for countries and regions
FR6: Users can view a Country Instability Index with threat level indicators per country
FR7: Users can view prediction market data (Polymarket) alongside geopolitical and threat assessments
FR8: The system can aggregate data from 35+ external sources across 17 intelligence domains
FR9: The system can cache AI summaries and threat classifications via a multi-tier cache (in-memory → Redis → upstream API)
FR10: The system can degrade gracefully when any individual data source is unavailable, misconfigured, or rate-limited — affected panels display an informative status rather than crashing
FR11: The system can operate with any subset of API keys configured — panels with available keys show data, panels without keys show a "not configured" state
FR12: The system can fall back through the AI summarization chain (Groq → OpenRouter → browser-side T5) when higher-priority providers are unavailable
FR13: Users can share country-specific analysis URLs that generate rich social preview cards (OG title, description, image)
FR14: The system can detect social media crawler bots and serve them HTML with OpenGraph meta tags
FR15: The system can generate dynamic OG preview images with country name, instability score, threat level, and branding
FR16: Real users clicking shared links are redirected to the SPA with deep-link parameters that auto-navigate to the relevant country and analysis panel
FR17: The system can serve story URLs (`/api/story`) as HTML pages for crawlers, supporting search engine indexability
FR18: Users can view previously cached data when network connectivity is lost
FR19: The system can serve static assets from cache and fetch data over network (cache-first for assets, network-first for data)
FR20: Users can access an offline fallback page when the full application cannot load
FR21: The operator can deploy the application to separate Preview (QA) and Production environments
FR22: The operator can configure environment variables (API keys, Redis URLs) scoped independently per environment
FR23: The system can maintain separate Redis cache instances (or key prefixes) for QA and Production to prevent cross-environment cache pollution
FR24: The operator can promote changes from QA to Production only after validation in the Preview environment
FR25: The operator can verify the build configuration (rewrites, cache headers, route patterns) resolves correctly after deployment
FR26: The system can run an automated quality gate on every pull request (lint, unit tests, proto breaking change detection, build, E2E tests)
FR27: The system can block production deployment when the CI pipeline fails
FR28: The operator can run an endpoint smoke test script that validates all 57 endpoints return non-error responses
FR29: The operator can run a Lighthouse audit against the deployed Preview environment and record baseline scores
FR30: Every PR that changes fork-specific code includes at least one test exercising the changed path
FR31: The operator can merge upstream changes via a dedicated `upstream-sync` branch without affecting the main branch
FR32: The operator can run proto/sebuf codegen (`make generate`) and verify generated output matches committed files after an upstream merge
FR33: The system can detect proto breaking changes via `buf breaking` as part of the CI pipeline
FR34: The operator can run the full test suite against the upstream-sync branch before merging to main
FR35: The application displays Situation Monitor branding (not World Monitor) in page titles, meta tags, and descriptions
FR36: The LLM discoverability files (`llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`) reflect Situation Monitor identity and content
FR37: Generated OG preview images display Situation Monitor branding
FR38: The system serves a `robots.txt` that permits crawling of public pages

### NonFunctional Requirements

NFR1: Initial page load (Largest Contentful Paint) completes in under 4 seconds on broadband connections (P1)
NFR2: Globe becomes interactive (Time to Interactive) within 6 seconds of navigation (P1)
NFR3: Individual data panel refreshes complete within 2 seconds of user action or data request (P1)
NFR4: Static assets are served with immutable cache headers (≥1 year) to eliminate redundant downloads on repeat visits (P2)
NFR5: The service worker caches static assets on first visit, enabling sub-second repeat load times for cached resources (P2)
NFR6: Edge function responses return within 500ms for Redis cache hits. Cold starts may add up to 2 seconds on first invocation per region. (P1)
NFR7: OG image generation completes within Vercel Hobby tier constraints (10-second serverless timeout, 128MB memory) (P0)
NFR8: API keys are never committed to source control or exposed in client-side code (P0)
NFR9: API keys are stored exclusively as Vercel environment variables, scoped per deployment environment (Preview vs Production) (P0)
NFR10: The edge middleware blocks known scraper and abuse bot user-agents while allowing legitimate social preview bots (P2)
NFR11: No user authentication data or personally identifiable information is collected, stored, or transmitted (P2)
NFR12: All traffic between users and Vercel is served over HTTPS (enforced by Vercel infrastructure) (P0)
NFR13: Redis connections use TLS encryption (enforced by Upstash) (P0)
NFR14: Site availability of 99%+ as provided by Vercel's infrastructure (no self-managed uptime obligation) (P1)
NFR15: Failure of any single external data source does not cause application-wide errors — other panels continue functioning normally (P0)
NFR16: The CI pipeline produces identical pass/fail results on re-run of the same commit. Any test that fails intermittently is quarantined within 24 hours and fixed or removed within one week. (P1)
NFR17: Zero post-deployment regressions — every change passes through QA (Preview) before reaching Production (P0)
NFR18: The service worker provides continuity during brief network interruptions — cached views remain accessible, data refreshes when connectivity returns (P2)
NFR19: All non-globe UI elements (panels, controls, text content) meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) (P2)
NFR20: All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard Tab navigation in a logical order (P2)
NFR21: Focus indicators are visually distinct when navigating via keyboard (not suppressed for aesthetics) (P2)
NFR22: Screen readers can access panel text content including AI summaries, event lists, and data tables (P2)
NFR23: The offline fallback page meets basic accessibility standards (readable, navigable) (P2)
NFR24: The system tolerates external API response times up to 10 seconds before timing out and falling back to cached data or degraded state (P1)
NFR25: The system retries transient failures (5xx, network timeout) for external APIs with appropriate backoff — no retry storms (P1)
NFR26: Redis unavailability causes graceful degradation to direct upstream API calls, not application failure (P0)
NFR27: The AI summarization fallback chain (Groq → OpenRouter → browser-side T5) activates automatically without operator intervention (P1)
NFR28: External API rate limit responses (429) are handled by backing off and serving cached data where available (P1)
NFR29: Total monthly infrastructure cost remains at $0 across Vercel, Upstash, and all API providers. Any billable usage triggers investigation before the next billing cycle. (P0)
NFR30: Daily Upstash Redis command count stays below 8,000 (80% of free tier limit of 10,000). If exceeded, investigate caching patterns before tier upgrade. (P1)
NFR31: Environment variable changes propagate to Preview deployments within 2 minutes. Production deployment completes within 5 minutes of merge to main. (P1)
NFR32: The endpoint smoke test script (`scripts/validate-endpoints.sh`) can be run with any single API key removed to verify graceful degradation per domain. (P1)
NFR33: Running `make generate` on a clean checkout produces byte-identical output to the committed `src/generated/` files. Any drift fails the CI pipeline. (P0)

### Additional Requirements

#### From Architecture

**Infrastructure / Deployment Constraints:**
- ARCH-1: Vercel Hobby Tier imposes 100GB/month bandwidth limit — all architectural decisions must account for this ceiling
- ARCH-2: Upstash Redis Free Tier imposes 256MB storage limit alongside the command quota
- ARCH-3: Dual runtime model: Edge Functions (middleware, RPC gateway) and Serverless Functions (legacy API, OG image) have different timeout limits, memory models, and execution constraints — code must target the correct runtime
- ARCH-4: `VITE_VARIANT=full` is the only active build variant; tech and finance variants are excluded at build time
- ARCH-5: Three Tauri desktop config files are dormant for web-only deployment — do not modify or depend on them
- ARCH-6: Convex and Railway AIS Relay are dormant infrastructure — present in repo but excluded from architecture
- ARCH-7: Local development requires a two-process model: `make dev` (Vite SPA) + `vercel dev` (API emulation)
- ARCH-8: Build process is a strict 4-step pipeline: `make generate` → `make lint` → `make build` → `vercel build`

**Fork Hook Tier System:**
- ARCH-9: Every fork story MUST declare its tier (1/2/3) before implementation; Tier 3 changes require explicit justification
- ARCH-10: Tier 1 (Zero-touch): CSS custom property overrides, `<meta>` tags, favicon swap, static asset replacement
- ARCH-11: Tier 2 (Single-line hook): One import added to `main.ts` that runs after app init; all logic lives in `src/fork/`
- ARCH-12: Tier 3 (Upstream modification): Any change touching upstream files beyond the single `main.ts` hook — tracked as merge debt
- ARCH-13: The actual hook mechanism (DOM-ready callback, global event bus, or direct import) is TBD — the spike story must discover it
- ARCH-14: Sentry SDK addition is Tier 3 (modifies `package.json`, creating permanent merge debt)

**Fork Directory Structure & Code Isolation:**
- ARCH-15: Fork client code lives exclusively in `src/fork/` with defined files: `index.ts`, `branding.ts`, `monitoring.ts`, `config.ts`, and `__tests__/`
- ARCH-16: Fork-specific server endpoints go in `api/fork/` as legacy REST `.js` files — never create new proto domains for fork features
- ARCH-17: Fork E2E tests go in `e2e/fork/` — created as needed, not speculatively
- ARCH-18: `fork.env.example` documents fork-specific env vars only
- ARCH-19: Do NOT include `panels.ts` in initial structure — add only when a story requires panel customization
- ARCH-20: Fork code (`src/fork/**`) MUST NOT import directly from `src/generated/**` — import from `src/services/` or `src/types/`
- ARCH-21: Fork testing contract: all code in `src/fork/` requires unit tests in `src/fork/__tests__/` using `node --test`

**Implementation Patterns & Conventions:**
- ARCH-22: Fork branding uses `<style id="fork-theme">` block injected into `<head>` with `:root` overrides — `document.documentElement.style.setProperty()` is forbidden
- ARCH-23: Fork branding must not cause Cumulative Layout Shift > 0; DOM additions must be present in initial HTML or injected before first paint
- ARCH-24: Fork changes use `[fork] description` commit prefix; upstream syncs use `[sync] merge upstream vX.Y.Z`
- ARCH-25: Every fork function wraps in try/catch with graceful fallback and `console.warn('[fork] ...')` — fork errors must never crash the upstream app
- ARCH-26: Fork files use kebab-case filenames, named exports, strict TypeScript, with the try/catch graceful degradation pattern
- ARCH-27: 8 explicit anti-patterns defined: no React/Vue/Angular, no `src/generated/` imports in fork, no new proto definitions for fork, no `FLUSHDB`/`FLUSHALL`, no `@ts-ignore` without explanation, no `App.ts` mods without Tier 3 justification, no raw `fetch()` in fork code, no generated code imports in fork
- ARCH-28: Components use CSS classes (`.is-loading`, `.has-error`, `.is-empty`) not JS-driven visibility toggles; panels show skeleton/placeholder, not spinners

**Data Architecture Patterns:**
- ARCH-29: Redis key prefix (`qa:` / `prod:`) is enforced at the client wrapper level via `prefixedKey()` — direct Redis calls bypassing the wrapper are forbidden
- ARCH-30: A careless `FLUSHDB` nukes both environments — mitigated by never using `FLUSHDB`; use prefix-scoped `SCAN` + `DEL` instead
- ARCH-31: Date/time encoding: ISO 8601 strings in JSON responses, Unix timestamps in proto messages
- ARCH-32: API error responses follow: HTTP status codes + JSON `{ error: string }` body; server errors use `error-mapper.ts`
- ARCH-33: Three-tier cache hierarchy (in-memory → Redis → upstream) with QA/Prod isolation is the canonical caching pattern

**Upstream Sync Workflow:**
- ARCH-34: Upstream sync pattern: dedicated `upstream-sync` branch → merge upstream → full test suite → PR into `main`
- ARCH-35: `App.ts` (4,629 LOC God Object) is the highest-risk merge surface — any fork customization touching it creates guaranteed merge conflicts
- ARCH-36: Merge Risk Map: Critical = `App.ts`; High = `proto/**`, `src/generated/**`; Medium = domain handlers, `package.json`; Low = `public/`, `index.html`
- ARCH-37: Post-merge checklist: verify `main.ts` fork hook intact, run `make generate`, resolve `package.json` conflicts, run full test suite
- ARCH-38: Proto sync: run `make generate` after every upstream merge; if upstream changes the codegen tool, catch it before it silently breaks the build
- ARCH-39: Codegen dependency chain: `.proto` change → `buf generate` → `src/generated/` → `server/` imports; proto changes cascade across four directories

**Monitoring / Observability:**
- ARCH-40: Sentry free tier (5K errors/month) for client-side error tracking — surfaces crashes invisible to Vercel logs
- ARCH-41: Sentry environment tagging MUST use `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` (not Vite `MODE`)
- ARCH-42: Sentry `beforeBreadcrumb` filters external API fetch noise — only same-origin breadcrumbs captured
- ARCH-43: No Sentry DSN = Sentry silently disabled (follows graceful degradation pattern)
- ARCH-44: Sentry SDK adds ~20KB gzipped to bundle size
- ARCH-45: Solo operator observability constraint: if it can't be diagnosed from Vercel logs + Upstash dashboard + Sentry, it's too complex

**Testing & Verification Gaps:**
- ARCH-46: SwiftShader (software WebGL) in CI means visual features are effectively untestable in automated CI — require manual QA
- ARCH-47: Test runtime bifurcation: E2E in Chromium (Playwright), unit tests in Node.js — no shared test utility layer
- ARCH-48: 6 of 38 FRs (FR12–FR16, FR35) require manual QA — all visual/UX requirements with zero automated CI coverage
- ARCH-49: `buf breaking` is the ONLY automated API contract validation in the pipeline

**Spike & Validation Requirements:**
- ARCH-50: Fork Pattern Validation Spike must answer 3 pass/fail gates: (1) Does the Tier 2 hook mechanism work? (2) Do CSS variable changes propagate to all components? (3) Does it deploy cleanly to Vercel Preview?
- ARCH-51: Spike must also discover: actual hook mechanism and CSS variable coverage audit — results documented back into architecture doc
- ARCH-52: If spike fails any gate, revise the fork pattern before proceeding

**Growth-Phase Expansion (Architectural Pre-Mapping):**
- ARCH-53: Sitemap.xml generation → `api/fork/sitemap.js` (Tier 2)
- ARCH-54: Enhanced `/api/story` for crawler pages → modify upstream `api/story.js` (Tier 3)
- ARCH-55: SSR landing page → `api/fork/landing.js` + `public/landing.html` (Tier 2)
- ARCH-56: Structured data (JSON-LD) → extend `src/fork/branding.ts` (Tier 1)
- ARCH-57: `lighthouse-ci` in GitHub Actions → modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Tier 3)
- ARCH-58: Automated upstream sync detection → new `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` (Tier 2)

**Architectural God Object Risk:**
- ARCH-59: `App.ts` (4,629 LOC) owns component lifecycle, event routing, and panel management — bottleneck for fork customizations and highest-conflict file
- ARCH-60: Components don't communicate directly — all panel behavior routes through `App.ts`; fork hooks should observe but not mutate `App.ts` internal state

#### From UX Design

**Interaction Flow Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-1: Scan → Drill → Correlate three-phase loop; all three drill entry points (globe click, deep-link URL, ⌘K search) must produce identical panel activation results
- UX-REQ-2: Scan Depth Tiers — Glance (5s), Read (15–30s), Study (1–2min) without mode switching; each tier has exit ramp
- UX-REQ-3: Deep-Link Animation Skip — When `?c=` URL param is present, bypass ~800ms globe spin and snap to country view (~30 LOC, Tier 2 patch)
- UX-REQ-4: Deep-Link Invalid Param Fallback — bad country code or unknown panel type falls back to globe home view with World Brief
- UX-REQ-5: Rate-Limit Burst Handling on Shared Links — 1000+ simultaneous clicks serve cached/degraded version silently

**Data State Handling Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-6: Eight Panel Data States — Loading/Loaded/Stale(aging)/Stale(critical)/Error(transient)/Error(persistent)/Empty/Degraded with specific visual treatments per state
- UX-REQ-7: Never Show Blank Panel — panels always display skeleton → content → stale content → empty state
- UX-REQ-8: Never Hide Stale Data — stale data with timestamp is always preferred over loading spinner; stale-while-revalidate throughout
- UX-REQ-9: Per-Panel Independence — one panel's failure never affects another panel; no global error overlays for single-source failures

**Data Age Gradient & Freshness Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-10: Data Age Gradient via CSS saturation filter; `data-freshness` attribute (`fresh`|`aging`|`stale`) drives `saturate()` CSS filter (~10 LOC)
- UX-REQ-11: CSS Transition on Freshness State Changes — `transition: filter 2s ease`; disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`
- UX-REQ-12: Per-Data-Source Freshness Thresholds — configurable per source type (earthquakes: 10min/30min, predictions: 1h/3h, news: 15min/1h, etc.)
- UX-REQ-13: `RelativeTimeFormatter` Utility — single `setInterval` updating every 60s; pre-computes bracket thresholds, only updates on bracket change (~40 LOC)
- UX-REQ-14: Stale Data Warning Bars — hidden if <24h, amber at 24h–72h, red at >72h; always visible to all users (~80 LOC)

**Accessibility Requirements (Beyond WCAG AA):**
- UX-REQ-15: `AriaAnnouncer.ts` — single `aria-live="polite"` region with 2-second debounce batching panel state changes (~30 LOC)
- UX-REQ-16: OperatorDrawer Focus Trap — focus moves to first element, Tab cycles within drawer, Escape restores focus to badge
- UX-REQ-17: `prefers-reduced-motion` blanket rule for all fork animations via `[data-sm-component]` selector (~3 LOC)
- UX-REQ-18: Fork Component ARIA Labels — specific `aria-label` for each fork interactive element (HealthIndicator, OperatorBadge, OperatorDrawer, warning bars)
- UX-REQ-19: Data Age Gradient Accessible Supplement — text timestamp + warning bar provide same freshness info; no color-only signaling
- UX-REQ-20: Color Blindness text labels alongside traffic-light signals; no color-only information signaling

**Responsive & Mobile-Specific Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-21: OperatorDrawer full viewport width below 768px breakpoint
- UX-REQ-22: Touch Targets ≥ 44×44px for all interactive fork elements on mobile
- UX-REQ-23: 320px minimum viewport width support
- UX-REQ-24: `WhatYouMissedPanel` mobile anchor — banner above panel grid (Growth phase)
- UX-REQ-25: `HotspotDelta` SVG equivalent on mobile for DeckGL/D3 SVG fallback (Growth phase)

**Animation & Transition Specifications:**
- UX-REQ-26: Interaction speed targets: theme injection <200ms, globe render <2s, panel skeleton→content <3s, deep-link snap <1s, search modal <100ms, panel collapse/expand <200ms, panel drag 60fps, globe fly-to ~800ms, modal overlay <100ms
- UX-REQ-27: Skeleton Loader Only — no spinners; skeleton indicates shape of incoming content
- UX-REQ-28: Panel Header Renders Immediately — only body shows skeleton animation
- UX-REQ-29: Hotspot Delta Pulse Timing — 10s pulse then static teal ring; disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion` (Growth phase)

**Design System Token & Convention Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-30: `--sm-*` namespace enforcement — no hardcoded hex values; CI grep check
- UX-REQ-31: Accent Restraint Rule — `--sm-accent` for identity only (header brand mark, active state, hotspot emphasis, share CTA); prohibited for panel headers, body text links, data values
- UX-REQ-32: `data-sm-*` DOM attribute convention for all fork elements; no new DOM IDs from fork code
- UX-REQ-33: CSS Cascade Position Rule — `<style id="fork-theme">` must be last stylesheet in `<head>`; E2E assertion required
- UX-REQ-34: No `!important` in fork CSS (sole exception: `prefers-reduced-motion` blanket rule); CI lint check
- UX-REQ-35: Light Mode Defensive Teal Override — `[data-theme="light"] { --accent: var(--sm-accent-light, #00838f); }` for 4.6:1 AA contrast
- UX-REQ-36: No New CSS Classes in Upstream Stylesheets — fork styles exclusively in `theme-inject.ts` or `theme.css`
- UX-REQ-37: FOUC Prevention — CSS tokens inlined as template literal in `theme-inject.ts`; no external CSS file load

**Performance Instrumentation Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-38: `performance.mark()` at fork lifecycle points: `sm-theme-injected`, `sm-globe-rendered`, `sm-panels-loaded`, `sm-deep-link-resolved` (~15 LOC)
- UX-REQ-39: Branding Injection < 200ms assertion via Playwright Performance API

**Testing Requirements (UX-Specific):**
- UX-REQ-40: Playwright Visual A11y Tests — `@axe-core/playwright` in `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` (~30 LOC)
- UX-REQ-41: OperatorDrawer Focus Trap Test — dedicated test
- UX-REQ-42: Tier 2 Patch Signature Assertions — `console.assert` verifying original method exists with expected arity; tested in companion `*.test.ts`
- UX-REQ-43: Fork CSS Lint CI Checks — grep for hardcoded hex, missing `aria-label`, `data-sm-*` attributes, `!important` violations
- UX-REQ-44: `prefers-reduced-motion` system toggle test — verify HotspotDelta pulse disabled and freshness transition instant
- UX-REQ-45: Post-Upstream-Sync Visual Verification < 2 Minutes — Playwright screenshot comparison of 3 key views + DOM assertions

**Pattern Adoption Checklist:**
- UX-REQ-46: PR Checklist for Fork Components — 18-point checklist including token usage, accent restraint, skeleton loaders, stale data preservation, ARIA labels, touch targets, reduced motion, and focus trap testing

**Component-Level UX Behaviors:**
- UX-REQ-47: `HealthIndicator` — 8px colored dots in panel headers for data source freshness; operator-gated (~120 LOC)
- UX-REQ-48: `OperatorBadge` + `OperatorDrawer` split architecture — badge always rendered, drawer lazy-loads on click
- UX-REQ-49: Startup Compatibility Notification — dismissible amber bar when Tier 2 monkey-patch signature assertion fires; operator-only, once per session
- UX-REQ-50: No Toast/Snackbar Notifications — data changes communicated through panel content updates only
- UX-REQ-51: Modal Rules — one modal at a time, background scroll lock, Escape always closes, click-outside for non-critical
- UX-REQ-52: Default Panel Order Configuration — fork-specific default sequence from `src/fork/config/default-panel-order.ts` placing priority correlation pairs adjacent
- UX-REQ-53: InsightsPanel Position-Locked Above Fold — P0 requirement for scan phase
- UX-REQ-54: Globe Empty State — always shows country boundaries immediately from static TopoJSON
- UX-REQ-55: Panel Empty State — light italic "No {dataType} data available for {countryName}"
- UX-REQ-56: Search Empty State — "No results for '{query}'" with suggestion text
- UX-REQ-57: InsightsPanel Generating State — skeleton with "Generating world brief..." placeholder
- UX-REQ-58: Uniform Globe Detection — must ensure baseline visual activity even during calm periods
- UX-REQ-59: Overwhelming Globe Prevention — severity weighting must create visual contrast hierarchy

**Growth-Phase UX Requirements:**
- UX-REQ-60: Hotspot Delta Detection — pulsing teal ring around new/escalated markers; delta from localStorage via `VisitTracker.ts` (~150 LOC)
- UX-REQ-61: "What You Missed" Panel — collapsible card at top of InsightsPanel for returning visitors (~180 LOC)
- UX-REQ-62: `VisitTracker.ts` Service — localStorage-based visit tracking with versioned schema (~120 LOC)
- UX-REQ-63: MobileWarningModal Softening — suppress/replace "desktop recommended" modal for deep-link arrivals

### Prerequisite: Fork Pattern Validation Spike (Story 0)

**Goal:** Validate the fork architecture works before committing to implementation.

**Three pass/fail gates:**
1. Does the Tier 2 hook mechanism work? (DOM-ready callback / event bus / direct import — discover which)
2. Do CSS variable changes propagate to ALL 52 components, or are some hardcoded?
3. Does it deploy cleanly to Vercel Preview?

**If any gate fails:** Revise fork architecture before proceeding to Epic 1.

**Key requirements:** ARCH-9–13, ARCH-22–23, ARCH-50–52
**Outcome:** Hook mechanism documented, CSS coverage audit complete, Vercel Preview deploy verified. Architecture doc updated with findings.

---

### Epic 1: Deployment & Quality Pipeline

**Goal:** Operator can deploy to QA and Production environments with automated quality gates and operational confidence.

**FRs covered:** FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30
**P0 NFRs addressed:** NFR8, NFR9, NFR17, NFR29, NFR33
**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-1–3, ARCH-7–8, ARCH-16–18, ARCH-24, ARCH-29–30, ARCH-46–49

**User outcome:** Every code change flows through a validated pipeline — lint, test, build, proto-break detection — before reaching production. QA and Production are isolated. The operator has confidence that nothing ships broken.

---

### Epic 2: Situation Monitor Identity

**Goal:** Users see Situation Monitor branding — not World Monitor — everywhere they encounter the app.

**FRs covered:** FR35, FR36, FR37, FR38
**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-10, ARCH-15, ARCH-22–23
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-30–37, UX-REQ-38–39

**User outcome:** Fork theme injection with `--sm-*` tokens, header/attribution text, favicon, meta tags, `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` updated, `robots.txt` serving, light mode defensive teal override, performance marks at lifecycle points. Zero CLS. FOUC prevented via inlined tokens.

---

### Epic 3: Social Sharing & Deep Links

**Goal:** Users can share country-specific analysis URLs that generate rich social previews and auto-navigate recipients to the right view.

**FRs covered:** FR13, FR14, FR15, FR16, FR17
**P0 NFRs addressed:** NFR7
**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-3
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-3–5, UX-REQ-26

**User outcome:** Country analysis URLs generate OG cards with SM branding. Bot detection serves meta tags. Real users get deep-link `?c=` param with globe animation skip. Invalid params fall back to globe home. Rate-limit bursts on viral shares serve cached/degraded content silently. Story URLs indexable as HTML.

---

### Epic 4: Panel Data States & Freshness

**Goal:** Users always see the freshest available data with clear age indicators; panels never go blank.

**FRs covered:** FR10, FR11
**P0 NFRs addressed:** NFR15, NFR26
**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-28, ARCH-31–33
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-6–14, UX-REQ-27–28, UX-REQ-50, UX-REQ-52–59

**User outcome:** 8 panel data states with specific visual treatments. CSS saturation gradient for data age. Per-source configurable freshness thresholds. `RelativeTimeFormatter` utility (single setInterval, bracket-change updates). Stale warning bars (hidden/<24h, amber 24–72h, red >72h). Skeleton loaders (no spinners). Panel header renders immediately. Default panel order with correlation pair adjacency. Globe always shows baseline activity. Stale data never replaced with loading state.

---

### Epic 5: Accessibility & Design System Compliance

**Goal:** All fork components meet WCAG AA, follow the design system contract, and work across devices.

**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-15–25, UX-REQ-30–37, UX-REQ-40, UX-REQ-43–44, UX-REQ-46
**Key NFRs:** NFR19–23

**User outcome:** `AriaAnnouncer` with 2s debounce. `prefers-reduced-motion` blanket rule. ARIA labels on all fork interactive elements. Color blindness text supplements. Touch targets ≥44×44px. 320px min viewport. CSS cascade position assertion. No `!important` (except motion rule). Fork CSS lint CI checks (hex, aria-label, `data-sm-*`, `!important`). Playwright axe-core a11y tests. PR checklist enforced.

---

### Epic 6: Upstream Sync Workflow

**Goal:** Operator can safely merge upstream World Monitor updates without breaking the fork.

**FRs covered:** FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34
**P0 NFRs addressed:** NFR33
**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-34–39, ARCH-59–60
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-42, UX-REQ-45

**User outcome:** Documented `upstream-sync` branch pattern. Post-merge checklist (fork hook intact, `make generate` passes, dependency conflicts resolved, full test suite green). Merge Risk Map referenced. Playwright screenshot comparison for <2min visual verification of 3 key views. Tier 2 patch signature assertions catch upstream breaking changes at boot.

---

### Epic 7: Operational Monitoring & Observability *(MVP/Growth boundary)*

**Goal:** Operator can monitor data source health, diagnose issues, and catch fork compatibility problems at a glance.

**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-40–45
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-16, UX-REQ-18, UX-REQ-21–22, UX-REQ-41, UX-REQ-47–49
**Key NFRs:** NFR32

**User outcome:** Sentry integration (Tier 3, ~20KB gzipped). `HealthIndicator` per-panel status dots (operator-gated). `OperatorBadge` + lazy-loaded `OperatorDrawer` with focus trap, mobile full-width, touch targets. Startup compatibility notification bar (amber, once per session, operator-only). Endpoint smoke test with key-removal verification.

---

### Epic 8: Returning Visitor Experience *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

**Goal:** Returning visitors instantly see what changed since their last visit.

**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-60–62, UX-REQ-24–25, UX-REQ-29, UX-REQ-44

**User outcome:** `VisitTracker.ts` localStorage service with versioned schema. `HotspotDelta` pulsing teal rings on changed markers (DeckGL + SVG mobile fallback). "What You Missed" collapsible card in InsightsPanel (mobile: banner above grid). `prefers-reduced-motion` pulse test.

---

### Epic 9: Enhanced Cross-Panel Correlation *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

**Goal:** Users can interactively cross-reference data across panels with visual highlighting.

**FRs covered:** FR4 (enhancement layer)
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-64, UX-REQ-51

**User outcome:** Click country in CII panel → highlights corresponding data in Economic/Military panels. Extends spatial proximity correlation to interactive linking. Modal rules enforced. Ships the "opinions about events" differentiator.

---

### Epic 10: Discoverability & SEO *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

**Goal:** Search engines and AI tools discover, index, and present Situation Monitor content.

**Key ARCH reqs:** ARCH-53–58
**Key UX reqs:** UX-REQ-63

**User outcome:** `api/fork/sitemap.js` (Tier 2). Enhanced `/api/story` for crawler pages (Tier 3). SSR landing page. JSON-LD structured data. `lighthouse-ci` in GitHub Actions (Tier 3). Automated upstream sync detection workflow. Mobile warning modal softening for deep-link arrivals.

## Prerequisite: Fork Pattern Validation Spike

### Story 0.1: Fork Pattern Validation Spike

As an **operator**,
I want to validate that the fork architecture (Tier 2 hook, CSS variable propagation, and Vercel deploy) works end-to-end,
So that I can proceed with branding and feature work with confidence that the foundation is sound.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a clean checkout of the fork repository
**When** I create `src/fork/index.ts` and `src/fork/config.ts` as the minimal fork skeleton
**And** add a single Tier 2 hook import in `main.ts` (one import from `src/fork/index.ts`)
**Then** the import executes after app initialization without errors in the browser console
**And** the hook mechanism type is documented (DOM-ready callback / event bus / direct import)

**Given** the Tier 2 hook is in place
**When** I inject `<style id="fork-theme">` with `:root` CSS variable overrides (e.g., `--sm-accent: #4dd0e1`)
**Then** the override propagates to a representative sample of at least 10 components across 3 categories (panels, modals, globe container)
**And** any components with hardcoded values that DON'T respond are documented in a CSS coverage audit
**And** the full 52-component audit is deferred to Epic 2

**Given** the hook and CSS injection are working locally
**When** I push to a branch and Vercel creates a Preview deployment
**Then** the Preview deployment loads without errors, fork theme is visible, and CLS = 0
**And** the three spike gates are documented as PASS/FAIL in the architecture doc

**Given** any spike gate fails
**When** the failure is analyzed
**Then** the fork architecture section is revised before any Epic 1 work begins
**And** the revised approach is re-validated through the same three gates

**Tier:** 2 (single `main.ts` import) — may discover Tier 3 needs during spike

---

## Epic 1: Deployment & Quality Pipeline

### Story 1.1: Vercel Environment Configuration & Redis Key-Prefix Isolation

As an **operator**,
I want Preview and Production environments with isolated Redis namespaces,
So that QA testing never pollutes production cache data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Vercel project is configured
**When** I set environment variables (API keys, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) scoped to Preview and Production
**Then** each environment uses its own variable values independently
**And** API keys are never committed to source control (verified by grep of `.env*` patterns in `.gitignore`)

**Given** the Redis client wrapper exists
**When** a Preview deployment writes to Redis key `summaries:US`
**Then** the actual Redis key is `qa:summaries:US`
**And** a Production deployment writing the same logical key creates `prod:summaries:US`

**Given** the `prefixedKey()` wrapper is in place
**When** CI runs a grep check for direct Redis calls bypassing the wrapper
**Then** the check passes with zero violations (automated, not convention-dependent)

**Given** the environment is configured
**When** a new contributor checks the repository
**Then** `fork.env.example` documents all fork-specific environment variables with descriptions

**Tier:** 1

---

### Story 1.2: CI Pipeline — Lint, Test, Build, Proto Breaking Change Detection

As an **operator**,
I want an automated quality gate that runs on every PR,
So that broken code never reaches production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a CI runner environment
**When** the pipeline starts
**Then** `buf` CLI is available (installed via CI step or pre-cached)

**Given** a PR is opened against `main`
**When** the CI pipeline triggers
**Then** it executes in order: `make generate` (verify byte-identical) → `make lint` → project's configured test runner (unit tests) → `buf breaking` (proto contract) → `make build` → Playwright E2E tests
**And** any step failure fails the entire pipeline and blocks merge

**Given** `make generate` produces output that differs from committed `src/generated/` files
**When** the CI step compares output
**Then** the pipeline fails with a clear diff message

**Given** the CI pipeline has run on a commit
**When** the same commit is re-run
**Then** the result is identical (deterministic — NFR16)

**Given** a PR changes files in `src/fork/`
**When** the CI pipeline runs
**Then** it verifies `src/fork/__tests__/` contains at least one test file (non-empty test directory gate)

**Tier:** 1

---

### Story 1.3: Endpoint Smoke Test Script

As an **operator**,
I want a script that validates all endpoints return non-error responses,
So that I can quickly verify deployment health after any change.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the application is deployed to a target environment
**When** I run `scripts/validate-endpoints.sh` with the target URL
**Then** it hits all endpoints and reports pass/fail for each
**And** the summary asserts "tested N endpoints, expected 57" — a count mismatch is a visible warning

**Given** a single API key is removed from the environment
**When** I run the smoke test
**Then** the affected domain endpoints show graceful degradation (non-500 response with informative body)
**And** all other endpoints still pass (NFR32)

**Tier:** 1

---

### Story 1.4: Lighthouse Baseline Audit

As an **operator**,
I want to run Lighthouse against the Preview environment and record baseline scores,
So that I have a reference point for detecting future performance regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a Preview deployment is live
**When** I run the Lighthouse audit script against the Preview URL
**Then** it produces scores for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
**And** baseline scores are recorded in a trackable format (JSON or CI artifact)

**Tier:** 1

---

### Story 1.5: Production Promotion & Deploy Verification

As an **operator**,
I want to promote validated Preview changes to Production and verify the deploy,
So that I know Production is correctly configured and serving traffic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** changes have passed all CI checks and are validated in Preview
**When** the PR is merged to `main`
**Then** Vercel automatically deploys to Production within 5 minutes (NFR31)

**Given** a Production deployment completes
**When** I verify the build configuration
**Then** rewrites, cache headers (`immutable` on static assets — NFR4), and route patterns all resolve correctly (FR25)
**And** the endpoint smoke test passes against the Production URL

**Given** a CI pipeline failure
**When** the PR attempts to merge
**Then** the merge is blocked (FR27)

**Tier:** 1

---

## Epic 2: Situation Monitor Identity

### Story 2.1: Fork Theme Injection & CSS Token System

As a **user**,
I want the application to display Situation Monitor's visual identity from the very first frame,
So that I recognize the product as Situation Monitor, not World Monitor.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the application loads in a browser
**When** the first paint occurs
**Then** `<style id="fork-theme">` is present in `<head>` with `:root` overrides for all `--sm-*` tokens
**And** the style block is the **last** `<style>` child of `<head>` (CSS cascade position — UX-REQ-33)
**And** `performance.mark('sm-theme-injected')` fires
**And** theme injection completes in < 200ms (UX-REQ-39)

**Given** the theme is injected
**When** I inspect the fork CSS
**Then** zero `!important` declarations exist (exception: `prefers-reduced-motion` blanket rule — UX-REQ-34)
**And** zero hardcoded hex values exist in `src/fork/` (UX-REQ-30)
**And** `document.documentElement.style.setProperty()` is never used (ARCH-22)

**Given** the user has light mode active (`[data-theme="light"]`)
**When** the fork theme applies
**Then** `--accent` resolves to `var(--sm-accent-light, #00838f)` yielding 4.6:1 contrast ratio (UX-REQ-35)

**Given** the theme injection runs
**When** CLS is measured
**Then** Cumulative Layout Shift = 0 (ARCH-23)
**And** tokens are inlined as template literal in `theme-inject.ts`, not an external CSS file load (UX-REQ-37)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 2.2: Header, Attribution & Favicon

As a **user**,
I want to see "Situation Monitor" in the page title, header area, and browser tab,
So that the product identity is clear across all touchpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the application loads
**When** I check the browser tab
**Then** `<title>` contains "Situation Monitor" (not "World Monitor")
**And** the favicon is the Situation Monitor icon (replaced in `public/favico/`)

**Given** the main view renders
**When** I look at the header/attribution area
**Then** "Situation Monitor" branding text is visible
**And** the text uses `--sm-accent` for identity emphasis per the accent restraint rule (UX-REQ-31)
**And** attribution text follows the `data-sm-component="attribution"` convention (UX-REQ-32)

**Given** the branding elements are injected
**When** CLS is measured
**Then** CLS remains 0 — elements are injected before first paint or are present in initial HTML (ARCH-23)

**Tier:** 1 + 2

---

### Story 2.3: Meta Tags, robots.txt & LLM Discoverability Files

As a **search engine bot or AI tool**,
I want meta tags, `robots.txt`, and LLM discoverability files to reflect Situation Monitor identity,
So that the correct product appears in search results and AI responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a crawler requests the application
**When** it reads `<meta>` tags in the HTML `<head>`
**Then** `og:site_name`, `description`, and `application-name` reference "Situation Monitor"

**Given** a crawler requests `/robots.txt`
**When** the response is returned
**Then** it permits crawling of public pages (FR38)
**And** the file references "Situation Monitor" in comments

**Given** an AI tool requests `/llms.txt` or `/llms-full.txt`
**When** the response is returned
**Then** the content reflects Situation Monitor identity, capabilities, and data sources (FR36)
**And** no references to "World Monitor" remain in these files

**Tier:** 1

---

## Epic 3: Social Sharing & Deep Links

### Story 3.1: OG Meta Tags & Bot Detection Middleware

As a **user sharing a link on social media**,
I want the shared URL to generate a rich preview card,
So that my audience sees a meaningful preview before clicking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a social media bot (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Telegram) requests a country URL
**When** the edge middleware detects the bot user-agent
**Then** it serves HTML with OpenGraph meta tags: `og:title` (country + threat level), `og:description` (AI summary excerpt), `og:image` (dynamic preview image URL), `og:site_name` ("Situation Monitor")
**And** legitimate social preview bots are allowed while known scraper/abuse bots are blocked (NFR10)

**Given** a real user clicks the same shared link
**When** the request reaches the application
**Then** they are redirected to the SPA with deep-link parameters (`?c={countryCode}`) that auto-navigate to the relevant country and analysis panel (FR16)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 3.2: Dynamic OG Preview Image Generation

As a **user sharing a country analysis link**,
I want the preview card to show a dynamic image with the country name, instability score, and threat level,
So that the shared link is visually compelling and informative.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a bot requests the OG image URL for a specific country
**When** the serverless function generates the image
**Then** it renders: country name, instability score, threat level indicator, and Situation Monitor branding (FR37)
**And** generation completes within 10-second Vercel Hobby timeout and 128MB memory limit (NFR7)

**Given** the OG image has been generated recently
**When** another request arrives for the same country
**Then** the cached version is served from Redis (multi-tier cache — FR9)

**Given** an invalid country code is requested
**When** the OG function processes it
**Then** it returns a generic Situation Monitor branded fallback image (never a broken image or error)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 3.3: Deep-Link Navigation & Animation Skip

As a **user arriving via a shared link**,
I want to land directly on the relevant country view without waiting for globe animation,
So that I immediately see the analysis that was shared with me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the URL contains `?c={countryCode}` parameter
**When** the SPA loads
**Then** the ~800ms globe spin animation is bypassed and the view snaps directly to the country (UX-REQ-3)
**And** `performance.mark('sm-deep-link-resolved')` fires (UX-REQ-38)
**And** resolution completes in < 1 second (UX-REQ-26)

**Given** the URL contains an invalid country code or unknown panel type
**When** the SPA processes the deep-link
**Then** it falls back to globe home view with World Brief — never shows an error page (UX-REQ-4)

**Given** a shared link generates burst traffic (1000+ simultaneous clicks)
**When** the API rate limit is hit
**Then** cached/degraded content is served silently — never a spinner or error to the user (UX-REQ-5)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 3.4: Story URL HTML Pages for Crawlers

As a **search engine crawler**,
I want `/api/story` URLs to return indexable HTML,
So that Situation Monitor content appears in search results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a crawler requests a `/api/story` URL
**When** the server processes the request
**Then** it returns an HTML page with structured content, meta tags, and Situation Monitor branding (FR17)
**And** the HTML includes proper `<title>`, `<meta description>`, and canonical URL

**Given** a real user requests the same `/api/story` URL
**When** the server detects a non-bot user-agent
**Then** it redirects to the SPA with appropriate deep-link parameters

**Tier:** 2

---

## Epic 4: Panel Data States & Freshness

### Story 4.1: Eight Panel Data States & Skeleton Loaders

As a **user**,
I want every panel to always show me something meaningful — data, stale data, or a clear status — never a blank space,
So that I can trust the interface and understand what's happening with each data source.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a panel is loading data for the first time
**When** the request is in progress
**Then** the panel header renders immediately (static) and the body shows a skeleton pulse animation (2s ease-in-out loop, `--surface` → `--surface-hover` gradient sweep — UX-REQ-27, UX-REQ-28)
**And** no spinner elements are used anywhere

**Given** a panel has loaded data successfully
**When** the data is fresh
**Then** the panel displays full content with `data-freshness="fresh"` attribute and no special indicators

**Given** a panel's data source returns an error
**When** the panel has previously loaded data
**Then** it preserves the last-known content and shows an amber "Source temporarily unavailable" bar (transient) or red "Source unavailable" bar (persistent — UX-REQ-6)
**And** the panel auto-retries silently for transient errors

**Given** a panel has no data and no cached data
**When** the empty state renders
**Then** light italic text displays "No {dataType} data available for {countryName}" — no error styling, no sad-face icons (UX-REQ-55)

**Given** a panel receives partial data
**When** the degraded state renders
**Then** partial content is shown with "Partial data — X of Y sources responding" indicator (UX-REQ-6)

**Given** one panel's data source fails
**When** other panels are checked
**Then** they continue functioning normally — no global error overlays (UX-REQ-9, NFR15)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 4.2: Data Age Gradient & Freshness CSS Saturation

As a **user scanning the dashboard**,
I want my peripheral attention to naturally gravitate toward panels with the freshest data,
So that I focus on what's most current without consciously checking timestamps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a panel's data refresh cycle updates the freshness state
**When** data transitions from `fresh` to `aging`
**Then** `data-freshness` attribute updates to `"aging"` and CSS applies `filter: saturate(0.85)` to `.panel-body` (UX-REQ-10)
**And** the filter change uses `transition: filter 2s ease` — no jarring snap (UX-REQ-11)

**Given** data transitions from `aging` to `stale`
**When** the panel updates
**Then** `data-freshness` updates to `"stale"` and CSS applies `filter: saturate(0.7)` (UX-REQ-10)

**Given** the user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled
**When** a freshness state changes
**Then** the transition is instant (no 2s ease) — respects motion preference (UX-REQ-11, UX-REQ-17)

**Given** freshness thresholds are needed for different data sources
**When** the configuration is checked
**Then** thresholds are configurable per source type: earthquakes (warn: 10min, critical: 30min), predictions (warn: 1h, critical: 3h), news (warn: 15min, critical: 1h), military (warn: 30min, critical: 2h), default (warn: 5min, critical: 1h) — UX-REQ-12

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 4.3: RelativeTimeFormatter & Stale Warning Bars

As a **user**,
I want to see human-readable timestamps that update in real-time and prominent warnings when data is very old,
So that I know exactly how current each panel's information is.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** panels display timestamps
**When** the `RelativeTimeFormatter` utility runs
**Then** a single `setInterval` fires every 60s (not per-panel — UX-REQ-13)
**And** it pre-computes bracket thresholds (< 1m, < 5m, < 1h, < 1d) and only updates DOM text when the bracket *changes*
**And** this avoids 26 unnecessary DOM writes per tick (~40 LOC)

**Given** a panel's data is less than 24 hours old
**When** the stale warning bar is evaluated
**Then** no warning bar is visible (UX-REQ-14)

**Given** a panel's data is 24–72 hours old
**When** the warning bar renders
**Then** an amber "Last updated X ago" bar appears inside the panel content area (UX-REQ-14)
**And** the bar has `role="status"` for accessibility (UX-REQ-18)

**Given** a panel's data is > 72 hours old
**When** the warning bar renders
**Then** a red "Last updated X ago" bar appears (UX-REQ-14)
**And** warning bars are always visible to ALL users, not operator-gated

**Given** a panel refreshes with new data while showing stale content
**When** the refresh completes
**Then** new content replaces stale content directly — stale data is never replaced with a loading spinner first (UX-REQ-8)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 4.4: Default Panel Order & Correlation Pair Adjacency

As a **user**,
I want panels arranged so that related intelligence domains are next to each other by default,
So that I can cross-reference correlated data at a glance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a new user visits (no persisted localStorage order)
**When** the panel grid renders
**Then** panels load in the fork-specific default sequence from `src/fork/config/default-panel-order.ts` (UX-REQ-52)
**And** priority correlation pairs are adjacent: Military+Prediction, Seismic+Humanitarian, CII+Economic

**Given** a returning user has a persisted panel order in localStorage
**When** the panel grid renders
**Then** the user's persisted order is used — fork defaults never override user preference (UX-REQ-52)

**Given** `InsightsPanel` is in the default layout
**When** the desktop view renders
**Then** `InsightsPanel` is visible above the fold without scrolling — position-locked as P0 requirement (UX-REQ-53)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 4.5: Globe Visual Baseline & Empty State Handling

As a **user**,
I want the globe to always show meaningful visual activity and never appear broken,
So that I can distinguish "nothing significant happening" from "data isn't loading."

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the globe is loading
**When** the initial render occurs
**Then** country boundaries from static TopoJSON are visible immediately — the globe is never visually empty (UX-REQ-54)
**And** `performance.mark('sm-globe-rendered')` fires after first meaningful paint (UX-REQ-38)

**Given** all global threat levels are low (calm period)
**When** the globe renders hotspots
**Then** baseline visual activity is present to distinguish "peaceful" from "data missing" (UX-REQ-58)
**And** severity weighting creates clear visual contrast hierarchy — uniform glow is prevented (UX-REQ-59)

**Given** the search modal is open with no results
**When** the empty state renders
**Then** text displays "No results for '{query}'" with suggestion "Try a country name, event type, or keyword" (UX-REQ-56)

**Given** `InsightsPanel` is generating AI content
**When** the generating state renders
**Then** skeleton loader displays with "Generating world brief..." placeholder text — never empty (UX-REQ-57)

**Tier:** 2

---

## Epic 5: Accessibility & Design System Compliance

### Story 5.1: AriaAnnouncer & Debounced ARIA Live Region

As a **screen reader user**,
I want panel state changes announced in batches rather than individually,
So that I'm informed without being overwhelmed by rapid-fire announcements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** multiple panels change state within a short time window
**When** the `AriaAnnouncer` processes the changes
**Then** a single hidden `<div aria-live="polite">` batches announcements within a 2-second debounce window (UX-REQ-15)
**And** the output is "3 panels have stale data" rather than 3 separate announcements

**Given** a single panel changes state in isolation
**When** 2 seconds pass without additional changes
**Then** the individual change is announced (e.g., "Military panel: data stale")

**Given** the `AriaAnnouncer` is present in the DOM
**When** no state changes are occurring
**Then** the live region is empty and does not produce announcements

### Story 5.2: prefers-reduced-motion Blanket Rule & Fork Component ARIA Labels

As a **motion-sensitive user**,
I want all fork animations disabled system-wide,
So that the interface respects my OS accessibility preference.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled at OS level
**When** any fork component renders
**Then** all animations and transitions are disabled via blanket CSS rule: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { [data-sm-component] { animation: none !important; transition-duration: 0s !important; } }` (UX-REQ-17)
**And** upstream animations are unaffected (they don't use `data-sm-component`)

**Given** a fork interactive element renders
**When** it is inspected for accessibility
**Then** it has an `aria-label` appropriate to its role (UX-REQ-18):
- Stale warning bar → `role="status"`
- No toast/snackbar notifications exist anywhere (UX-REQ-50)

**Given** data freshness is communicated via CSS saturation
**When** accessibility is evaluated
**Then** text timestamp + warning bar provide the same information accessibly — no color-only signaling (UX-REQ-19, UX-REQ-20)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 5.3: Responsive Mobile Support & Touch Targets

As a **mobile user**,
I want all fork elements to be usable on my device,
So that the experience works regardless of screen size.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the viewport is ≤ 768px
**When** interactive fork elements render
**Then** all touch targets are ≥ 44×44px (UX-REQ-22)

**Given** the viewport is 320px wide (minimum supported)
**When** fork components render
**Then** no horizontal overflow occurs and all content is readable (UX-REQ-23)

**Given** modal rules apply
**When** a modal opens
**Then** only one modal at a time, background scroll locked, Escape always closes, click-outside closes non-critical modals (UX-REQ-51)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 5.4: Fork CSS Lint CI Checks & Playwright A11y Tests

As an **operator**,
I want automated checks that catch accessibility and design system violations before merge,
So that fork quality doesn't degrade over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a PR is opened that modifies `src/fork/`
**When** CI runs the fork CSS lint checks
**Then** it verifies: (1) zero hardcoded hex values in `src/fork/`, (2) `data-sm-*` attributes on fork DOM elements, (3) zero `!important` in fork CSS (except `prefers-reduced-motion`), (4) `aria-label` present on interactive fork elements (UX-REQ-43)

**Given** the Playwright test suite runs
**When** `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` executes
**Then** `@axe-core/playwright` scans the rendered page and catches WCAG AA contrast failures and missing ARIA attributes (UX-REQ-40)
**And** the test runs on every PR

**Given** the fork component PR checklist (UX-REQ-46)
**When** a PR reviewer checks compliance
**Then** the 18-point checklist is referenced in the PR template

**Tier:** 1

---

## Epic 6: Upstream Sync Workflow

### Story 6.1: Upstream Sync Branch Pattern & Post-Merge Checklist

As an **operator**,
I want a documented, repeatable process for merging upstream changes,
So that I can keep the fork current without risking breakage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a new upstream release is available
**When** I create an `upstream-sync` branch
**Then** upstream changes are merged into this branch (never directly into `main` — ARCH-34)
**And** the process follows: merge → resolve conflicts → full test suite → PR into `main`

**Given** the upstream merge is complete on the sync branch
**When** I run the post-merge checklist
**Then** it verifies: (1) `main.ts` single-line fork hook is intact, (2) `make generate` output matches committed files, (3) `package.json` Sentry dependency conflicts resolved, (4) full test suite passes (ARCH-37)

**Given** the Merge Risk Map is referenced
**When** conflicts arise
**Then** I prioritize by risk: Critical = `App.ts`, High = `proto/**`, `src/generated/**`, Medium = domain handlers, `package.json`, Low = `public/`, `index.html` (ARCH-36)
**And** the post-merge checklist is documented in `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`

**Tier:** 1

---

### Story 6.2: Tier 2 Patch Signature Assertions

As an **operator**,
I want monkey-patches on upstream methods to automatically detect when upstream changes break them,
So that I discover compatibility issues at boot rather than in production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a Tier 2 monkey-patch exists on an upstream method
**When** the application boots
**Then** `console.assert` verifies the original method exists and has expected arity (UX-REQ-42)
**And** assertion failure does NOT crash the app — follows graceful degradation (ARCH-25)

**Given** a patch signature assertion fires (method missing or arity changed)
**When** the operator is in operator mode
**Then** the startup compatibility notification bar appears (amber, dismissible, once per session — UX-REQ-49, implemented in Epic 7)

**Given** each Tier 2 patch has a companion test
**When** the test suite runs
**Then** the signature assertion is tested explicitly (UX-REQ-42)
**And** this catches upstream breaking changes at the unit test level after every sync

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 6.3: Post-Sync Visual Verification via Playwright Screenshots

As an **operator**,
I want to visually verify fork integrity in under 2 minutes after every upstream merge,
So that I can catch subtle visual regressions that automated tests miss.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an upstream merge is complete
**When** I run the Playwright screenshot comparison script
**Then** it captures screenshots of 3 key views: globe home, country drill-down, and OG card
**And** screenshots are compared against baseline images stored in the repo

**Given** a visual difference is detected
**When** the diff is presented
**Then** the operator can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate regression)
**And** the entire process completes in < 2 minutes (UX-REQ-45)

**Given** the screenshots are captured
**When** DOM assertions also run
**Then** `<style id="fork-theme">` position is verified as last `<style>` in `<head>` (UX-REQ-33)
**And** `data-sm-component` attributes are present on expected fork elements

**Tier:** 1

---

## Epic 7: Operational Monitoring & Observability

### Story 7.1: Sentry Integration (Tier 3)

As an **operator**,
I want client-side error tracking that surfaces crashes invisible to server logs,
So that I can diagnose WebGL context loss, ONNX failures, and service worker issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set
**When** the application initializes
**Then** Sentry SDK loads (~20KB gzipped — ARCH-44) with environment tag from `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` (not `MODE` — ARCH-41)
**And** `beforeBreadcrumb` filters external API fetch noise — only same-origin breadcrumbs captured (ARCH-42)

**Given** `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is NOT set
**When** the application initializes
**Then** Sentry is silently disabled — zero errors, zero console warnings (ARCH-43, graceful degradation)

**Given** a client-side error occurs
**When** Sentry captures it
**Then** the error is tagged with environment (`preview` or `production`) and fork version

**Tier:** 3 — modifies `package.json` (adds Sentry dependency), creating permanent merge debt. **Justification:** Tier 1/2 insufficient because Sentry requires a package dependency and early initialization before fork hook runs.

### Story 7.2: HealthIndicator Per-Panel Status Dots

As an **operator**,
I want to see at-a-glance data source health for every panel,
So that I can spot degraded sources without opening the operator drawer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** operator mode is enabled (`localStorage sm-operator-mode` or `?debug=1`)
**When** a panel renders
**Then** an 8px colored dot appears in the panel header (right side) showing freshness: Fresh/teal, Aging/amber, Stale/red, N/A/grey (UX-REQ-47)
**And** the dot has `aria-label="Data source status: {state}"` (UX-REQ-18)

**Given** operator mode is disabled
**When** the panel renders
**Then** no health indicator dots are visible

**Given** a dot's state changes
**When** the screen reader processes it
**Then** the change is announced via `AriaAnnouncer` (not individual `aria-live`) (UX-REQ-46 checklist)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 7.3: OperatorBadge + OperatorDrawer with Focus Trap

As an **operator**,
I want a floating badge showing overall system health and a detail drawer I can open on demand,
So that I can monitor all data sources in one place and link to diagnostic tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** operator mode is enabled
**When** the application renders
**Then** a floating badge appears (bottom-right) showing "{N}/{total} sources OK" or "{N} sources degraded" (UX-REQ-48)
**And** the badge has `role="button"`, `aria-label="{N} of {total} sources healthy"`, min 44×44px touch target (UX-REQ-18, UX-REQ-22)

**Given** the operator clicks the badge
**When** the drawer opens
**Then** a lazy-loaded `OperatorDrawer` slides in with per-source status list + Vercel dashboard link (UX-REQ-48)
**And** focus moves to the first element inside the drawer (UX-REQ-16)
**And** Tab cycles within the drawer only (focus trap — UX-REQ-16)
**And** Escape closes the drawer and restores focus to the badge (UX-REQ-16)

**Given** the viewport is ≤ 768px
**When** the drawer opens
**Then** it uses full viewport width (`width: 100vw`) instead of desktop's 320px (UX-REQ-21)

**Given** operator mode is disabled
**When** the application renders
**Then** neither badge nor drawer are present in the DOM

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 7.4: Startup Compatibility Notification Bar

As an **operator**,
I want to be alerted when upstream changes may have broken fork patches,
So that I can investigate compatibility issues immediately after an upstream sync.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a Tier 2 monkey-patch signature assertion fires at boot (method missing or arity changed)
**When** operator mode is enabled
**Then** a dismissible amber bar appears at page top: "Fork compatibility check: {N} patch(es) detected upstream changes. See operator overlay for details." (UX-REQ-49)
**And** the bar has `role="alert"`, `aria-live="assertive"` (UX-REQ-18)
**And** it appears once per session only (dismissed state stored in sessionStorage)

**Given** no signature assertions fire
**When** the application boots
**Then** no compatibility bar is shown

**Given** operator mode is disabled
**When** an assertion fires
**Then** no bar is shown (operator-only feature)

**Tier:** 2

## Epic 8: Returning Visitor Experience *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

### Story 8.1: VisitTracker.ts LocalStorage Service

As a **returning visitor**,
I want the app to know what the world looked like when I last visited,
So that it can show me what's changed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user visits the application
**When** they leave or close the tab
**Then** `VisitTracker.ts` stores a state snapshot in localStorage under key `sm-visit-snapshot` (~2KB) with versioned schema (`version: number`) (UX-REQ-62)

**Given** the user returns
**When** the app loads
**Then** the stored snapshot is loaded and delta computation runs against current data
**And** on schema version mismatch: migrate if possible, or discard + re-snapshot (never crash — UX-REQ-62)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 8.2: HotspotDelta Pulsing Markers

As a **returning visitor**,
I want to see which hotspots are new or escalated since my last visit,
So that I immediately focus on what changed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the `VisitTracker` has a previous snapshot
**When** new or escalated hotspots are detected
**Then** pulsing teal ring markers appear around changed hotspots on the globe (UX-REQ-60)
**And** the pulse runs for 10 seconds via `@keyframes pulse-ring`, then settles to a static teal ring (UX-REQ-29)

**Given** `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled
**When** delta markers render
**Then** static teal ring only — no pulse animation (UX-REQ-29, UX-REQ-44)

**Given** the device uses mobile SVG fallback (no WebGL)
**When** delta markers render
**Then** pulsing works on D3 SVG renderer identically to DeckGL desktop (UX-REQ-25)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 8.3: "What You Missed" Panel

As a **returning visitor**,
I want a summary of key changes since my last visit,
So that I can quickly catch up without scanning every panel.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the `VisitTracker` detects changes since last visit
**When** the InsightsPanel renders
**Then** a collapsible "What You Missed" card appears at the top with entries like "Taiwan: CII elevated 62→71", "New hotspot: Red Sea shipping" (UX-REQ-61)

**Given** the user dismisses the card
**When** they continue browsing
**Then** the card stays hidden until the next visit with changes

**Given** the viewport is ≤ 768px (InsightsPanel auto-hides on mobile)
**When** the content renders
**Then** the "What You Missed" card appears as a banner above the panel grid instead (UX-REQ-24)

**Given** it's the user's first visit (no snapshot)
**When** the app loads
**Then** no "What You Missed" card is shown

**Tier:** 2

---

## Epic 9: Enhanced Cross-Panel Correlation *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

### Story 9.1: Panel-to-Panel Interactive Highlighting

As an **analyst user**,
I want clicking a country in one panel to highlight corresponding data in adjacent panels,
So that I can cross-reference correlated intelligence interactively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the user clicks a country in the CII panel
**When** adjacent correlation pair panels (Economic, Military) are visible
**Then** corresponding data for that country is visually highlighted in those panels (UX-REQ-64)
**And** highlighting follows the accent restraint rule (teal for selection indicator, not information — UX-REQ-31)

**Given** the user clicks elsewhere or presses Escape
**When** the highlighting is active
**Then** highlights are cleared across all panels

**Given** modal rules apply
**When** any correlation interaction triggers a detail view
**Then** one modal at a time, Escape closes, background scroll locked (UX-REQ-51)

**Tier:** 2

---

## Epic 10: Discoverability & SEO *(Growth — planned, not estimated)*

### Story 10.1: Sitemap.xml & JSON-LD Structured Data

As a **search engine**,
I want a sitemap and structured data,
So that Situation Monitor content is properly indexed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a crawler requests `/api/fork/sitemap.js`
**When** the function responds
**Then** a valid sitemap.xml is returned listing all public country and story URLs (ARCH-53)

**Given** the SPA renders
**When** JSON-LD structured data is injected
**Then** it describes the application as a geopolitical intelligence monitor (ARCH-56)
**And** JSON-LD is added via `src/fork/branding.ts` extension (Tier 1)

**Tier:** Sitemap = Tier 2, JSON-LD = Tier 1

---

### Story 10.2: SSR Landing Page

As a **first-time visitor from search**,
I want a fast-loading landing page that explains Situation Monitor,
So that I understand the product before the full SPA loads.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a non-bot request hits the landing route
**When** the server responds
**Then** `api/fork/landing.js` serves `public/landing.html` with Situation Monitor branding, key features, and a CTA to enter the full app (ARCH-55)

**Tier:** 2

---

### Story 10.3: Enhanced Story Pages & Mobile Warning Softening

As a **mobile user arriving via deep link**,
I want a welcoming experience rather than a "desktop recommended" warning,
So that I'm not discouraged from exploring the shared content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a mobile user arrives via a deep-link (`?c=` parameter)
**When** the mobile warning modal would normally appear
**Then** it is suppressed — the user goes directly to the country view (UX-REQ-63)

**Given** an organic mobile visitor (no deep-link)
**When** the mobile warning would appear
**Then** a subtle dismissible banner replaces the blocking modal (UX-REQ-63)

**Given** a crawler requests an enhanced `/api/story` URL
**When** the server responds
**Then** the HTML includes richer content, Situation Monitor branding, and structured data (ARCH-54, Tier 3)

**Tier:** 2 + 3

---

### Story 10.4: Lighthouse CI & Automated Upstream Sync Detection

As an **operator**,
I want automated performance monitoring and upstream sync alerting,
So that regressions are caught without manual checking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a PR is opened
**When** CI runs
**Then** `lighthouse-ci` executes and reports scores alongside existing checks (ARCH-57, Tier 3)

**Given** a new upstream release is published
**When** the automated detection workflow runs
**Then** a notification (GitHub issue or workflow alert) is created in the fork repo (ARCH-58, Tier 2)

**Tier:** 3 + 2
